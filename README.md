Munchies
========

A re-creation of Michael Fan's 1996-2001 game, Munchies [(Official Website)](http://www.mikefan.com/munchies/)

Munchies was originally created by Michael Fan in 1996 for Apple Macintosh OS 7. Its final version 1.0.7, was released in 2001.

This re-creation, made in 2012 by me, Andrew Scott, was my first foray into "real" programming after working only with scripting languages for 3+ years. It is coded entirely in C# targeting Microsoft's .NET 4.0 framework, and uses all of the images and sounds from the original game.

The motivation behind this recreation came from my search for a productive project to complete over winter break. The favorite game from the childhood of my siblings and I was the perfect place to begin.

Mr. Fan has graciously given permission for me to make the source of this re-creation, including the resources, available. Under no circumstances may this work be used for commercial purposes or otherwise for profit.
